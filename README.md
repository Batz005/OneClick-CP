📦 Features

1. 🚀 Reset Files

Quickly reset your main.cpp, input.txt, and output.txt based on the currently selected template. Templates include:
	•	default
	•	Fast_IO
	•	Debug_Template
	•	CP_Template
	•	🔧 Custom templates

2. 📤 Export Solution

Save your current code and input/output files to a Solutions/ folder with a custom name you choose.

3. 🔁 Export + Reset

Combine both reset and export in a single action to move to your next problem.

4. 💾 Create Custom Templates

Save your currently open main.cpp, input.txt, and/or output.txt as a new reusable template. You control:
	•	Template name
	•	Which files to include

5. 📚 Code Snippets (Editor-Based)

Write faster using our curated snippets library. Snippets are automatically available for:
	•	C++ (cpp_basics, cpp_ds, cpp_algos, cpp_adv_algos)
	•	Java
	•	Python

Use them directly via VS Code’s built-in IntelliSense (start typing the prefix like cpdijk for Dijkstra).

⚠️ Snippets currently work via editor autocomplete and not inside the sidebar UI.

6. 🧠 Coming Soon
	•	Dynamic snippet search & categorization in sidebar
	•	Integration with Codeforces, LeetCode, etc.
	•	Problems dashboard, contest timers, and more!
